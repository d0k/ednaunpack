* documentation

* make use of java.concurrency
** threadpool
** queue instead of on-demand parsing of the filelist
** I also think that there are some synchronization issues in the current code

* get filelist directly from setup.exe
** will be complicated since the layout changes almost every inno setup version

* better GUI
